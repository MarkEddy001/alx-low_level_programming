0x0A. C - argc, argv

General Learning Objectives

    How to use arguments passed to your program
    What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you     use one or the other
    How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unus    ed variables or parameters

TASK 0 Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

    If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
    You should not remove the path before the name of the program

TASK 1 Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

    Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

TASK 2 Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

    All arguments should be printed, including the first one
    Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

TASK 3 Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

    Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
    You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
    If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

TASK 4 Write a program that adds positive numbers.

    Print the result, followed by a new line
    If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
    If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
    You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int
