Task 0x0A-Argc_ Argv

Argc just represents the number of things that we enter into the command prompt when running our executables.
argv is an array of strings. Its elements are the individual command line arguement strings. The file name of the program being run is also included in the vector as the first element; the value of argc counts this element.
